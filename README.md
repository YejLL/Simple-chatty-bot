# project in python: chatty-bot
simple chat bot named "Avril". Try to talk with "avril"! Maybe She wants to know more about you. 

## About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

## Description
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.
In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.


## Learning outcomes
